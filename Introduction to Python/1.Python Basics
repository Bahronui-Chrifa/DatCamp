Q : 
 Experiment in the IPython Shell; type 5 / 8, for example.
Add another line of code to the Python script on the top-right (not in the Shell): print(7 + 10).
Hit Submit Answer to execute the Python script and receive feedback.
solution  : 
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)
print ( type(5/8))
# Print the sum of 7 and 10
print( 7+10)
 Q 2 : 
  
You want to do some quick calculations.

For your new business, you want to develop a database-driven website.

Your boss asks you to clean and analyze the results of the latest satisfaction survey.
All of the above. 
 Q 3 : 
  Above the print(7 + 10), add the comment

# Addition 
 solution : 
 # Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition 
print(7 + 10) 
 Q 4 : 
 Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's  dollars, and after two years it's . Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years, and print the result.
 Solution : 
 # Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?

print ( 100  *1.1 **7 )  
 Q 5 : 
 Create a variable savings with the value 100.
Check out this variable by typing print(savings) in the script. 
 solution : 
 # Create a variable savings
savings = 100 

# Print out savings
print ( savings ) 
 Q6 : 
 Create a variable growth_multiplier, equal to 1.1.
Create a variable, result, equal to the amount of money you saved after 7 years.
Print out the value of result. 
 solution : 
 # Create a variable savings
savings= 100  

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier= 1.1 

# Calculate result
result= savings * growth_multiplier **7  

# Print out result
print ( result )

 Q 7 : 
 Create a new string, desc, with the value "compound interest".
Create a new boolean, profitable, with the value True.
 solution : 
 # Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable= True  
 Q8 : 
 
a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool 
 Q 9 : 
  Calculate the product of savings and growth_multiplier. Store the result in year1.
What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of year1.
Calculate the sum of desc and desc and store the result in a new variable doubledesc.
Print out doubledesc. Did you expect this? 
 Solution : 
  savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of savings and growth_multiplier to year1
year1= savings * growth_multiplier **1

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc= desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print ( doubledesc)
Q10 : 
Calculate the product of savings and growth_multiplier. Store the result in year1.
What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of year1.
Calculate the sum of desc and desc and store the result in a new variable doubledesc.
Print out doubledesc. Did you expect this?
 solution : 
  savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of savings and growth_multiplier to year1
year1= savings * growth_multiplier **1

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc= desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print ( doubledesc) 
 Q11 : 
 Hit Run Code to run the code. Try to understand the error message.
Fix the code such that the printout runs without errors; use the function str() to convert the variables to strings.
Convert the variable pi_string to a float and store this float as a new variable, pi_float. 
 Solution : 
 # Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)

 Q12 : 
 "The correct answer to this multiple choice exercise is answer number " + 2
